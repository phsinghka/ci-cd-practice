## Prerequisites

To successfully complete this project, ensure you have the following:

- [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/download/) installed and running on your local machine or server.
- GitHub account and a repository.
- Installed the following Jenkins plugins:
  - Git Plugin
  - GitHub Plugin
- GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) for secure authentication with Jenkins.

## Project Overview

This project involves integrating Jenkins with GitHub, enabling Jenkins to:
1. Clone this GitHub repository.
2. Trigger Jenkins jobs automatically when a new push or pull request is made.
3. Run automated build pipelines to check code quality and run tests.

By the end of the project, Jenkins will be capable of automating build, test, and deployment tasks whenever changes are made to the code in this repository.

## Integration Steps

1. **Install Jenkins Plugins**
   - Install the `Git` and `GitHub` plugins from the Jenkins plugin manager.

2. **Set Up GitHub Credentials in Jenkins**
   - Create a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) and add it to Jenkins credentials.

3. **Create Jenkins Job**
   - Set up a new Jenkins job to pull code from this GitHub repository.
   - Configure the job to trigger automatically using GitHub webhooks.

4. **Configure GitHub Webhook**
   - In the GitHub repository, set up a webhook that points to your Jenkins server's GitHub integration URL.

5. **Test the Integration**
   - Push a code change to this GitHub repository and observe how Jenkins triggers a build job automatically.

For detailed steps on how to complete the integration, refer to the project documentation.
